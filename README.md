# Wendy

Wendy is a Python GUI framework that allows to build an application GUI with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ajax. </br>It uses CEF (Chrome Embedded Framework) to embed WxPython forms , through Flask to start a local server to respond to GUI requests .</br>The project GUI uses the popular AdminLTE template (Free admin dashboard template based on Bootstrap 4) by default, you can replace any template you want, please refer to Flask for replacement rules.</br>You can always download this project and modify it into your application. </br>The project also provides a packager script to make the application easier to distribute.

Wendy是一个Python GUI框架，它允许用HTML、CSS、Javascript、Ajax建立一个应用程序的GUI。 </br>它使用CEF嵌入WxPython窗体，通过Flask启动本地服务器来响应GUI请求。</br>项目GUI默认使用了流行的AdminLTE模板，您可以随意替换任意模板，替换规则请参考Flask。</br>您可以随时下载本项目并修改成为你的应用程序。 </br>本项目还提供了打包程序脚本使得程序更方便分发。

# Components

`wxPython` - 构建窗体

`CEF Python` - Chrome Embedded Framework

`Flask` - 本地 web Server

`Gevent` - 启动 Flask 服务

`AdminLTE` - Bootstrap Web UI

`xmlhttprequest` - Communication with Flask to update UI

`eel` - A little Python library


# How to Use

## Get Started

### Clone

Clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/kangvcar/Wendy.git`

### Setup Environment

- Python==3.7
- Flask==2.0.1
- cefpython3==66.1
- PyInstaller==3.6
- wxPython==4.1.1
- gevent==21.1.2

```
pip install pipenv
cd Wendy
pipenv install
pipenv shell
# Start the application
python -m wendy
```

### Test Application

`cd` into the repo folder.  
Start the application to make sure everything is working `python -m wendy`  
The application comes with a sample GUI with some interactions with the backend.  
The included HTML and Javascript functions are a sample of how actions can be performed.

## Structure

### \_\_main\_\_.py

Starts the application.  It is a `cefpython` (portable chrome browser) application, and the windowing system.  
It calls a function called `find_port()` which finds an open port on the local machine.  
It then calls the function `start_server()` which starts the Flask web server.

### start_gevent.py

This file is used to run `gevent` which handles running Flask and the incoming connections from your web gui.  
`start_gevent` is importing the Flask application from `app.py`

### app.py

This is the Flask application.  This is where routing for http calls will be, creating the HTML, and the backend of 
the application.  
This is where main part of the application is handled. 

### \_\_info\_\_.py

Fields that contain your application name and related information.

### \_\_init\_\_.py

Configures paths for the application.  
Contains functions for getting and creating paths for your application.  

### Templates directory

Contains the HTML files for the application

### Static directory

Contains the resources for the HTML files. Fonts, images, javascript libraries etc.

## Rebrand Project 

### Windowing and Icons

The top of \_\_main\_\_.py sets the size of the application.  
`icon.ico` is the icon used by the window.  

When creating an icon, you can bundle multiple sizes together to ensure it appears nicely at different sizes.  
You can download [icobundle](http://telegraphics.com.au/sw/product/ICOBundle) to combine the icons into one file.  
You can use this command. It also shows the different sizes you should create (eg icon24.ico is the 24x24 pixels size)  
`.\icobundl.exe -o icon.ico icon16.ico icon24.ico icon32.ico icon40.ico icon48.ico icon64.ico icon96.ico icon128.ico icon256.ico`

### Name, version etc

Modify `__info__.py`

## Modifying the Application

After rebranding the project, development on the new application can begin.

### Main Program Logic

`app.py` is the Flask application that controls the main logic of the application.  
Sample AJAX functions are included in the HTML to communicate with the backend Flask application.

### GUI

`Bootstrap` is used for the HTML.  This is not required, any HTML can be used.  
Modifying the files in the `templates` and `static` directories will allow you change the GUI.  
You call run `python app.py` and go to `localhost:5000` in your browser to work on your application without having 
to execute `__main__.py`.  
`templates/index.html` contains Javascript calls to the backend to retrieve data.

## Create Windows Executable and Installer

### PyInstaller and exe

An exe for the application is created with PyInstaller.  
`build/build.spec` is the PyInstaller spec which configures PyInstaller.  
Extra files and directories to include (eg icon.ico) are set in the spec file.  
To prevent the console window from appearing set `EXE(console=False)`.  

### NSIS installer

Install NSIS [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download)  

The installer is created with nsis.  
`build/installer.nsi` is the template that will be automatically modified when creating a new build.  
Modify `build/icon.ico` and `build/header.bmp` for your application.  
Modify `build/license.txt` to be the contents of your application's license.  
Modify the fields at the top of `build/build.py`  

### Create new build

`$ cd build/`  
`$ python build.py`  

This will run pyinstaller to create the exe, copy it into `build/dist/`, and then create the installer with nsis.  
A file containing multiple hashes of the installer is also created.
